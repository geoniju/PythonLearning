"""Collections"""

"""
Collections in Python are containers that are
used to store collections of data.
"""

# Types of containers data types
#list
#dict
#set
#tuple



""" String """
greeting = "Hello there"

#greeting[0] = 'M'

"""List"""

# construct an empty list

my_list = []

# construct a list with values

my_list = [1, 3.4, 'a string', True]


print(my_list.insert()




"""
Tuples

It's a data type for immutable ordered sequences of elements. 
"""

my_tup = ()

# to construct tuple having single value
my_tup = (50,)

my_tup = ('physics','chemistry',1997,2000)
my_tup2 = (1,2,4,5)
my_tup3 = "a","b","c","c"

""" 
Sets 

A set is a data type for mutable unordered collections of unique elements. 
One application of a set is to quickly remove duplicates from a list.

"""

set_list = set(my_list)
print(set_list)

# to create empty set
my_set = {}

my_set = {'apple','banana','cherry'}




""" 
Dictionaries and Identity Operators 
A dictionary is a mutable data type that stores mappings of unique keys to values. 
"""

my_dict = {}

my_dict = {'Name':'Zara','Age':7,'Class':'First'}

"""Dictionaries can have keys of any immutable type, 
like integers or tuples, not just strings."""
